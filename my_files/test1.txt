A **File Integrity Checker** is a tool used to ensure that files on a system have not been altered, deleted, or corrupted. It works by creating a unique fingerprint or hash (using algorithms like SHA-256 or MD5) for each file at a certain point in time. This fingerprint (or hash) is stored in a secure location, usually in a database or a file.

Later, the integrity checker can compare the current hash of each file with the stored hash to verify whether the file has been modified. If the fileâ€™s content has changed, its hash will differ from the original, alerting the user to the potential modification, corruption, or tampering of that file.

### Key features:
- **Hash Generation**: It computes hash values (using algorithms like SHA-256, MD5) of files when they are initially created or stored.
- **Integrity Check**: Periodically checks the current hash against the original hash to detect any changes or alterations.
- **Alerts**: Notifies the user if any files have been modified, deleted, or added.
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized tampering of critical files, making it useful for ensuring the integrity of system files, sensitive data, and software installations.

### Common Use Cases:
- **File System Security**: Ensures that system files, configuration files, and critical application files are not tampered with by malware or unauthorized users.
- **Backup Verification**: Verifies that files have not been altered during backup and restore processes.
- **Software Integrity**: Checks if the files of installed software packages or updates have been modified or corrupted. 

In summary, a file integrity checker helps maintain the security and reliability of files by detecting unauthorized changes.
